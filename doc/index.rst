Cleanship is a citizen participation (BÃ¼rgerbeteiligung) / complaints &
suggestion management (Anliegenmanagement) / ... online platform that
allows you to submit issues about the public infrastructure. The local
administration will then review your note and the solution process is
public visible.

Basics
======

It is the successor of :term:`Klarschiff`, a platform where citizens report problems / ideas concerning public infrastructure.
The municipality staff does then review, check and fix this issues.

The code is Python3 using the Django 2 framework and bootstrap3
webfrontend toolkit.

.. note::
  Currently we port only existing features, while avoiding old bottlenecks.
  New features will be introduced starting with version 0.3.
  
.. note::
   This version is a preview with a lot of limitations:
   - frontend UI not polished
   - read-only API
   - some performance issues
   - hardcoded settings

.. warning::
  Currently **alpha** , so expect that we will break your installation / data / modules / ... !
  Migrations will cause data lost!

Features
========

-  staff frontend (office)
-  issues with georeference
-  groups to maintain / delegate issues
-  admin backend
-  API compatible with :term:`CitySDK`
-  import :term:`Klarschiff` legacy data

|admin webinterface showing details of a opened issue|
|office webinterface showing details of a opened issue|

Usage
=====

-  start
   ``python3 manage.py runserver --settings cleanship.settings.local``
-  enter ``localhost:8000/admin`` to maintain issues
-  enter ``localhost:8000/office`` for staff backoffice
-  enter ``localhost:8000/citysdk`` for REST API

Setup
-----

On Linux you need to follow this steps to get a working instance

-  Setup postgres DBMS with geoextension

   -  ``sudo apt install pgadmin3 postgresql postgresql-10-postgis-2.4  postgresql-10-postgis-scripts``
   -  ``sudo -u postgres psql``
   -  ``CREATE USER cleanship WITH PASSWORD 'mysecretpass';``
   -  ``CREATE DATABASE cleanship OWNER cleanship;``
   -  ``ALTER ROLE cleanship CREATEDB SUPERUSER;`` (setting up test-dbs
      with GIS extension requires high privileges)
   -  ``\q``
   -  ``psql cleanship``
   -  ``CREATE EXTENSION postgis;``
   -  ``\q``

-  Setup python virtualenv

   -  ``sudo apt install python3-dev libpq-dev binutils libproj-dev gdal-bin``
   -  ``mkvirtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3 cleanship``
   -  ``workon cleanship``

-  Init codebase

   -  ``git clone cleanship``
   -  ``pip install -R requirements/base.txt`` (dev.txt for debugging /
      contributing)

-  Configure instance

   -  ``cp /cleanship/settings/example.py /cleanship/settings/local.py``
   -  Adapt your settings in ``/cleanship/settings/local.py``
   -  Apply DB tables with
      ``python3 manage.py migrate --settings cleanship.settings.local``
   -  Gather static assets to ./static
      ``python3 manage.py collectstatic --settings cleanship.settings.local``
   -  Test startup with
      ``python3 manage.py runserver --settings cleanship.settings.local``
   -  Create first admin user with
      ``python3 manage.py createsuperuser --settings cleanship.settings.local``
   -  Create ``/municipality_area.json`` which contains the outer border
      as polygon in CRS:4326 (e.g. `of
      Rostock <https://www.opendata-hro.de/dataset/gemeindeflaeche/>`__
   -  Create ``/eigentumsangaben.geojson`` which contains disjunct
      polygones CRS:25833 with char field ``eigentumsangabe`` about
      landowners
   -  Perform single tests with e.g.
      ``python3 manage.py test legacy/tests -v 2 --settings cleanship.settings.local``

-  Assign users to groups

   -  ``from common.models import User, Group``
   -  ``myself = User.objects.get(username='test')``
   -  ``group = Group.objects.get(name='a group')')``
   -  ``group = Group.objects.get(name='a group')')``
   -  ``group.user_set.add(myself)``
   -  ``group.save()``

Klarschiff migration
--------------------

You can transfer your existing issues from Klarschiff (tested v1.9) to
cleanship including issues, categories, groups. We highly recommend a
fresh cleanship setup to avoid troubles!

The import skips some checks to improve performance:

-  is in boundary polygon
-  updating location description
-  updating landowner

The following instructions are tested to transfer your Klarschiff
content:

-  export old data as CSV via this shell-script at your current
   Klarschiff DB server

   -  ``export PGPASSWORD="mypass" psql -h localhost -d klarschiff -U admin -Atc "select tablename from pg_tables" |\   while read TBL; do if [[ $TBL == *"klarschiff_"* ]]; then     psql -h localhost -d klarschiff -U admin -c "COPY $TBL TO STDOUT WITH (FORMAT CSV, HEADER);" > $TBL.csv fi   done``

-  copy all full size photos to /media directory:
   ``cp /srv/www/klarschiff/static/*_gross_*.jpg ./media``
-  Import via
   ``python3 manage.py import --settings cleanship.settings.local``
-  Import will take only a few minutes
-  Update DB squences

   -  ``SELECT setval(pg_get_serial_sequence('"common_issue"','id'), coalesce(max("id"), 1), max("id") IS NOT null) FROM "common_issue";``
   -  ``SELECT setval(pg_get_serial_sequence('"common_category"','id'), coalesce(max("id"), 1), max("id") IS NOT null) FROM "common_category";``
   -  ``SELECT setval(pg_get_serial_sequence('"common_comment"','id'), coalesce(max("id"), 1), max("id") IS NOT null) FROM "common_comment";``


Concepts
========

Cleanship focus to be a enterprise-grade selfhosted solution for the
public administrations. so it integrates in your existing IT and scales
for huge amount of users and notes. You can receive notes with
geolocation easily and maintain this issues to find a solution to this
note step-by-step.

-  LDAP support
-  multilanguage
-  scale with huge amount of issues (>40k tested so far)
-  history and logging
-  open API following :term:`CitySDK` protocoll

To get a basic understanding of the internals, you might have a look at
the base object definitions:

-  **issue** - problem / idea / tipp for a location, submitted by
   external or interal authors. e.g. a pothole within a specific street.
   Focus is the reported damage, not the solution itself. It's allways
   assigned to a group of a organisation
-  **category** - a 3 level categorisation by type (problem / idea /
   tipp), main-category and sub-category e.g. *problem - waste - bulky
   refuse*
-  **role** - a overall qualification for a user e.g. admin, editors,
   field service
-  **group** - a organisation unit of multiple users e.g. *civil
   engineering office*
-  **user** - a member of a organsiation

The django project is splitted in different **apps** focussing on single
aspects:

-  **common** - general aspects esp. shared models, admin frontend
-  **legacy** - compatibility features to migrate from old predecessor
   project :term:`Klarschiff`
-  **office** - internal frontend for staff
-  **citysdk** - :term:`CitySDK` API for public frontend / 3rd party apps & platforms


.. glossary::

   CitySDK
     A REST like API which `CitySDK participation <https://www.citysdk.eu/citysdk-toolkit/using-the-apis/open311-api/>`_ component was implemented at Klarschiff.
     It is a updated version of the `Open311 <https://www.open311.org/>`_ protocol, by exteding some core concepts.
     Klarschiff also added even more features, are completely covered `here <https://github.com/bfpi/klarschiff-citysdk>`_.

   Klarschiff
     Is the previous (legacy) software suite for civic participation management.
     It was splitted in a public and internal `frontend <https://github.com/bfpi/klarschiff-field_service>`_, both for mobile and desktop users.
     The database was managed by a `backend <https://github.com/bfpi/klarschiff-backend>`_ component, which offered a :term:`CitySDK` API to the frontends.
     See `Wikipedia (Klarschiff) <https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klarschiff>`_
     Cleanship replaces everything below the public frontends.
